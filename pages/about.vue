                    My name is Cormac McCann, I'm a 26 year old web developer from Dublin Ireland. I have
                    over five years of experience developing first class web applications. My main skill set revolves around
                     HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Right now my primary focus is Vue JS.

                    For the past two years Iâ€™ve been a frontend engineer working with Sylon in Dublin,
                    Ireland. My main focus within Sylon is building out an online platform to facilitate corporate innovation,
                    But I also devote some of my time to improving frontend process and managing the internal frontend
                    Communities or Practice (CoP).

                  Outside of web development I try to keep myself busy with a bunch of hobbies.
                  I have recently started tinkering with small robotics projects, inspired mainly by youtube channels like Mark Rober, Adam savage etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I love music, I play the guitar and collect records! This is kind of a problem as my partner and I have officially reached max record capacity in our tiny apartment.

                <p>
                  When I'm feeling really lazy I love nothing more than planting myself on the couch and loading up a good movie or TV show (Currently watching: WandaVision on Disney+).
