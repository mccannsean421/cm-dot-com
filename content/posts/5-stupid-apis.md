If you're anything like me you make a lot of frontend projects to learn a new thing. This can be dull if you're returning old weather data or some IMDB clone. I like my demos to be fun, and give people something to talk about. I find using a fun or silly API can not only make the development fun for me but also give the person I'm showing something to relate to.

So here are 5 fun APIs I found from around the internet.

## The Rick and Morty API

## The Father Ted API

[You can find the ApI here](https://fatherted.irish/)

## Marvel Comics API

[here](https://developer.marvel.com/)

## Brewerey API

[here](https://www.brewerydb.com/)

## NASA APIs

If you're someone who finds space exploration fascinating you might be interested to know that [Nasa](https://api.nasa.gov/) provide a whole host of really interesting APIS.
