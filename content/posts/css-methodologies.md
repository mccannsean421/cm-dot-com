There a several different methodologies that are widely used:

 - Block Element Modifier (BEM)
 - OOCSS (Object Orientated CSS)
 - Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACSS)

## BEM

BEM is the methodology I have the most epxerience with. To me it makes compliments the component
based architecture of Vue JS
