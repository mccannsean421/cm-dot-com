**Note talk more about the actual APIS**

If you're anything like me you make a lot of frontend projects to learn a new thing. This can be dull if you're returning old weather data or some IMDB clone. I like my demos to be fun, and give people something to talk about. I find using a fun or silly API can not only make the development fun for me but also give the person I'm showing something to relate to.

So here are 5 fun APIs I found from around the internet.

## The Rick and Morty API

Rick and Morty is probably one of the most recognisable shows out there. If you haven't seen the show itself, you've no doubt seen of the many
viral memes it's inspired. Either way even if you're just looking at the responses from this ApI in the network tab you or your colleagues are
bound to get a little kick out of it. You find out more [about the Rick and Morty API here](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

## The Father Ted API

Out of all the APIs on this list, I think I can safely say this is the dumbest... If you're not from Ireland or the UK you probably have no idea what you're looking at, but Father Ted was a satirical Channel 4 show from the late 90s. Massive in popularity even to this day, so if you have a new project in need of some dummy data this will be a fun solution. **I really do not recommend using this in a professional setting. More for a educational and side projects**

## Marvel Comics API

Lately Marvel superheros are something that just don't seem to lose popularity. Be it the movies, the Disney+ shows or even the comics everybody recognises some of the Marvel characters. This API has fantastic documentation and guides, it's really easy to get up and running. I used this API to make a Tinder style interface for superheros.

## Brewerey API

## NASA APIs

If you're someone who finds space exploration fascinating you might be interested to know that [Nasa](https://api.nasa.gov/) provide a whole host of really interesting APIs.
