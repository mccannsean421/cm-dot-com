Say for argument's sake you've been tasked by your manager to go and see what all the hype surrounding a new JavaScript frontend framework is about.
They want you to build a quick Hello World app that hits an API and displays the response in a nice UI. If you're like me, you've spotted the opportunity to finally use one of those fun wacky APIs you found on Reddit to liven things up a bit.

With this scenario in mind, here's five of said APIs:

## The Rick and Morty API

Rick and Morty is probably one of the most recognizable shows out there. If you haven't seen the show itself, you've no doubt seen of the many
viral memes it's inspired. Either way even if you're just looking at the responses from this ApI in the network tab you or your colleagues are
bound to get a little kick out of it. You find out more [about the Rick and Morty API here](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

## The Father Ted API

Out of all the APIs on this list, I think I can safely say this is the dumbest... If you're not from Ireland or the UK you probably have no idea what you're looking at, but Father Ted was a satirical Channel 4 show from the late 90s. Massive in popularity even to this day, so if you have a new project in need of some dummy data this will be a fun solution. **I really do not recommend using this in a professional setting. More for a educational and side projects**

## Marvel Comics API

Lately Marvel superheros are something that just don't seem to lose popularity. Be it the movies, the Disney+ shows or even the comics everybody recognizes some of the Marvel characters. This API has fantastic documentation and guides, it's really easy to get up and running. I used this API to make a Tinder style interface for superheros.

## Brewery API

Not only do I really love a good beer every now and again, I also appreciate easy access to a very well curated DB full of beers and breweries. The Brewery API is a really nifty REST API that's incredibly easy to get up and running with. [Find out more about the Brewery API](https://www.brewerydb.com/)

## NASA APIs

If you're someone who finds space exploration fascinating you might be interested to know that [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/) provide a whole host of really interesting APIs for the public to mess around with.

## That's it for now!

I love finding silly/interesting APIs I find they can inspire you to code up something fun. If you find any please feel free to send them my way!
